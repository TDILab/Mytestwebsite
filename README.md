## Cache-Control / HTTP caching

If you saw a warning that a `Cache-Control` header is missing or empty, that means the server (or CDN) serving the static files for this site isn't sending explicit cache headers. Modern browsers rely on those headers for efficient caching and to know when to revalidate files after a deploy.

I've added example configuration files for several common hosting environments so you can pick the one matching your deployment:

- `_headers` — Netlify (_place at repository root_). Sets `no-cache` for HTML and a long `max-age, immutable` for fingerprinted static assets.
- `.htaccess` — Apache (when hosting on Apache/mod_headers + mod_expires). Adds Expires and Cache-Control rules.
- `web.config` — IIS (Windows / Azure App Service). Adds a default clientCache and an outbound rule to set no-cache for HTML.
- `vercel.json` — Vercel platform. Declares headers for HTML and static files.

Notes and recommended policy:
- HTML pages should be set to `no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0` so browsers check for newer versions after a deploy.
- Static assets (CSS/JS/images/fonts) should be served with a long cache lifetime (e.g. `max-age=31536000`) and `immutable` when you deploy fingerprinted assets (file names include a hash). This allows aggressive caching while still enabling updates when you change the asset name.
- GitHub Pages doesn't let you set HTTP response headers directly. If you deploy there you can either:
	- Use a Cloudflare Worker or a CDN in front to add headers, or
	- Implement a service-worker in the site that controls caching client-side, or
	- Move to a host that supports header configuration (Netlify, Vercel, custom server).

If you'd like, I can:
- Apply the matching config for your actual deployment target (if you tell me which host you use), or
- Add a minimal Service Worker example that implements a cache strategy for browsers when you can't set server headers.
